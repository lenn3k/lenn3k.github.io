      "summary": "This paper describes the development and validation of a smartphone application designed to distinguish between normal heart rhythms and premature ectopic beats. Using Photoplethysmography (PPG)—measuring blood flow changes via the phone's camera—researchers tested an algorithm on 28 volunteers in a controlled hospital setting. By comparing the smartphone data to a reference ECG, the study proved that the app could accurately identify irregularities and differentiate premature beats based on timing intervals. Ultimately, the research confirms that smartphones are capable of detecting specific cardiac arrhythmias beyond simple heart rate monitoring."
